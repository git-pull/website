# Why python?

Why you should pick up python as a programming language?

Why does git-pull write its libraries in python?

Python is more than a programming language, but when someone says it, they could mean:

- The python specification
- The CPython implementation
- The overall state of party packages, e.g. on PyPI
- A specific library they like - you'd need to clarify what they're thinking of by asking. e.g.
  Jupyter notebooks
