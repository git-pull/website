- What makes you better than other python tutors?

  See :ref:`mentoring/about_me`.

  You want someone who has worked at startups and brings experience to
  the table. You are entrepreurial-minded. You seek autonomy and to build your
  own product and vision. Specify your own deliverables and technical
  requirements. You're ready and willing to make an investment in your
  future. You value raw insight and knowledge first and foremost.

- Are you better than a code school?

  See above. Not to take a knock at code schools, many are great. But compare me
  side-by-side with instructors at an average code school. They're often
  contractors (with no labor protections) paid less than 50k a year. Many were
  themselves students from a prior class - not open source practitioners or
  startup veterans.

  And then those teachers go around and tell you you're going to make
  80k-100k when they themselves aren't. If they were so good at programming
  and the market is in such need for programmers (it's already saturated), why
  wouldn't they already be employed earning a higher wage?
  
  They have little to no one-on-one time - they're mills that cram 10, 15, or 20
  students into a cohort. Or street smarts, they haven't been through the
  ups and downs of startups to give you candid advice. Take your normal
  McAcademy BootCamp instructor, put them one-on-one with me in a Hackathon,
  it'd be a slaughter.

  I serve a different type of student. You yourself want to be a founder. My
  ideal student already has a career and savings - and are trying to augment
  what they *already* have.

  A big sticking point of bootcamps is some form of job afterwards,
  sometimes by the way of refunding if you don't get employed within a certain
  amount of time. If you want a guarantee of employment, go to a camp, they can
  be a "safety net" for you. But then, if you can't take risks and want job
  security, why are you doing startups?

  Want to work at Google? Study computer science, data structures and
  algorithms. Buy *Cracking the Code Interview* - a book that provides
  no useful skill outside interviewing. You can sit fantasizing you'll be the
  token Google hire after learning Angular, but it's more likely you'll be
  working at Trader Joe's with $16k down the drain.

  Don't fall for these mills. **Don't become a programmer out of desperation!**
  Bootcamps take advantage of your naivete through creating an illusion their
  flimsy accredition matters. Nobody cares. In fact, there are reports of
  interviewers **throwing out resumes from code camps** [1]_ [2]_. You learn
  programming because you have a vision you want to realize.

  My approach kills three birds with one stone: Superior teacher,
  superior developer, and I don't feed into systems that take advantage of
  people who don't know better.

- Mobile development?

  Unfortunately, I don't provide that. Here's why:
  
  - It's a specialty. It's hard to pick up iOS or Android without going
    all-in.
    
  - For a student, it's much harder.
    
    - I estimate it taking you a year or longer to master it. That's not
      including backend stuff, which is a missing piece for many app
      developers I've seen.
    - There are already mobile developers that have been doing this
      for 8+ years. You're competing against seasoned pros that were
      around since there early days. It's hard to tie that in to a
      career or your own enterprise.

    Meanwhile, my workshop teaches responsive CSS media queries. So users
    can view your website on the browser without you even needing to waste
    time building an app.

  - It's much more effort to develop something meaningful in it. It
    requires learning new programming languages, huge API's, clunky
    IDE's, and slow build times and emulators.

    Compare that to instant feedback loops in web products. You're out
    to market faster.

  - The market is very picky

    There are already elite mobile applications for basically every
    business idea.

    Let's say you try to create a competitor. Mobile users do not like lag or
    bad UI's. They can review your application and leave negative reviews
    for something just not being their taste. If (heaven forbid) you have an
    actual glitch, they can be far less forgiving.

  - Even if you create a sweet app - you will still likely fail. Most people who
    sign up as Apple developers never even earn their $99 back:

        Apple developer fees than I have made from any of my apps?"

  My courses teach you how to create database driven REST API's that serve as a
  backend.

  There's also another option if you need to build a first-class mobile app
  down the road. My workshops cover ECMAScript (JavaScript). You could take what
  you've learned and use `react-native`_.
