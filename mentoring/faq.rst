Am I a fit for you?
-------------------

I'm not a tutor for everyone. If you don't like what I say here, maybe I'm
not. Me teaching a student means I need to divert time away from working on
other projects that could pan out. That includes actively *filtering out* people
who wouldn't like me or not get the results they want.

On the other hand, *I'm happy to accomodate students who appreciate my
frankness on this page*.

If what I say here makes sense, `let's talk`_!

FAQ
---

- What makes you better than other python tutors?

  See :ref:`mentoring/about_me`.

  You want someone who has worked at startups and brings experience to
  the table. You are entrepreurial-minded. You seek autonomy and to build your
  own product and vision. Specify your own deliverables and technical
  requirements. You're ready and willing to make an investment in your
  future. You value raw insight and knowledge first and foremost.

- Why Python?

  Python does everything.

  It's fast enough.

  Strong standard library.

  Code standards and hygeine.

  It can be faster if you leverage the right libraries.

  Scales well to medium-sized codebases.

  Solid web frameworks.

  Solid ML/AI.

  Scraping.

  Cleaning data.

  Flagship third party libraries: requests

  Testing. unittest + pytest

- Are you better than a code school?

  See above. Not to take a knock at code schools, many are great. But compare me
  side-by-side with instructors at an average code school. They're often
  contractors (with no labor protections) paid less than 50k a year. Many were
  themselves students from a prior class - not open source practitioners or
  startup veterans.

  And then those teachers go around and tell you you're going to make
  80k-100k when they themselves aren't. If they were so good at programming
  and the market is in such need for programmers (it's already saturated), why
  wouldn't they already be employed earning a higher wage?

  I serve a different type of student. You yourself want to be a founder. My
  ideal student already has a career and savings - and are trying to augment
  what they *already* have.
  
  Their teaching experience also sucks. They have little to no one-on-one time -
  cramming 10, 15, or 20 students into a class. They can't teach street smarts,
  they haven't been through the ups and downs of startups to give you candid
  advice. Take your normal McAcademy BootCamp instructor, put them one-on-one
  with me in a Hackathon, it'd be a slaughter.

  A big sticking point of bootcamps is some form of job afterwards,
  sometimes by the way of refunding if you don't get employed within a certain
  amount of time. If you want a guarantee of employment, go to a camp, they can
  be a "safety net" for you. But then, if you're risk averse and want job
  security, why are you doing startups?

  Want to work at Google? Study computer science, data structures and
  algorithms. Buy *Cracking the Code Interview* - a book that provides
  no useful skill outside interviewing. You can sit fantasizing you'll be the
  token Google hire after learning Angular, but it's more likely you'll be
  working at Trader Joe's with $16k down the drain.

  Don't fall for these mills. **Don't become a programmer out of desperation!**
  Bootcamps take advantage of your naivete through creating an illusion their
  flimsy accredition matters. Nobody cares. In fact, there are reports of
  interviewers **throwing out resumes from code camps** [1]_ [2]_.
  
  My approach kills three birds with one stone: Superior teacher,
  superior developer, and I don't feed into systems that take advantage of
  people who don't know better.

- Why don't you offer job positions / outcomes?

  1. You should be a founder.

  2. I don't want students who are desperate, out of options, and see
     programming as a last ditch effort to find employment.

  3. The ideal student already has a career and is augmenting or
     improving what they already have.

  4. The job market is already saturated with boot camp graduates over the
     past years.

  5. It's a risky career path an an employee. There are no unions. There are
     few protections to shield you from bad bosses, VC funding drying up,
     bad equity deals, and so on. Too much power on the side of the employer.

  6. (Lack of) respect for seniority
     
     Being a programmer as an *employee* isn't the panacea it's made to be on
     TV. After a few years of hard work, you'll become a senior programmer.
    
     **Startup route**

     *Sometimes*, there can be downsides. Nobody talks about them. These
     are anecdotes of people I know:

     "There *is* such a thing as BAD STARTUPS. They are rare, but they
     exist!"

     "You'll find, much to your shock, founders may view you as 'just another
     programmer'."
     
     "If it's a startup, *you may have more experience than your own founder*."
     If this causes friction, you'll always lose that one.

     "You could be stuck on the ride of some bigheaded loudmouth, who
     wouldn't even hire themself if they had the chance to."
     
     "... manager from hell with unchecked Dunning-Kruger, anyone who challenges
     the soundness of their ideas is canned." Will refuse take your input. They 
     could, like any other place, fail to treat you as a team member.

     So, there are non-startup startups. Because these sound a lot like
     *Dilbert* to me.

     **Large organizations**

     In good cases, the environment is professional, has a work-life
     balance, they have extensive support for employees having hardship,
     and if (in the unlikely event) you're having poor performance, they give 
     you a clear indication and a chance to rebound.

     In other words, there are fair employers. But I feel they're getting
     harder to find. That's why I don't guarantee outcomes.

     More and more often, in the USA:
     
     Larger organizations tell you to go to the back of the line and do
     brainteasers, code golf, and so on. No respect for seniority. Do you
     think you can be a better programmer than me? Will people at Google,
     Uber, and so on use your software? Because even if you're demonstrably
     elite, these companies still force you to do dog tricks to let you
     know `you're no snowflake`_.
     
     What was once a test of merit to harvest computer science chops has
     devolved into a draconian filter that serves as a passport protecting an
     entrenched system of careerists and bozos, not finding the best, or even
     minimally viable candidate to perform a role.

     This fundamentally prohibits you from reaching your potential.

     *Areas where I'm optimistic*

     Entrepreneurs, founders, DIY-types. **Building your own portfolio of
     intellectual property and attaining customers is the ultimate validation of
     yourself**. I did it myself when I wrote my book. I'm doing it again now
     with my SAAS tools.
     
     **Those currently employed augmenting their career with awesome Python
     skills** is another type of student I could be a match with.

     .. _you're no snowflake: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante

  6. The nature of personalized instruction
     
     I run a small shop where I give individualized instruction to gifted
     students. Not a year round operation. It's not tenable to offer guarantees
     with this model.
     
     Code camps are able to because they have 30 students in a class. If
     they have one drop out, they're shielded in case someone fails.
- Will you be my reference?

  I will be a reference and reliable witness to your ability, as well as your
  strengths learning.
  
  Also, as a reminder, **I support my students through follow-ups included in
  the worshops** and **expect you to attend all of them**. This is
  important for reflecting on your improvements over time.

  I look highly on students that exhibit:
  
  - Improved / Good code quality
  - Live website, service, product in staging, or better yet,
    production quality
  - Open source contributions
    
  These are areas of expertise where I can vouch.
- Mobile development?

  Unfortunately, I don't provide that. Here's why:
  
  - It's a specialty. It's hard to pick up iOS or Android without going
    all-in.
    
  - For a student, it's much harder.
    
    - I estimate it taking you a year or longer to master it. That's not
      including backend stuff, which is a missing piece for many app
      developers I've seen.
    - There are already mobile developers that have been doing this
      for 8+ years. You're competing against seasoned pros that were
      around since there early days. It's hard to tie that in to a
      career or your own enterprise.

    Meanwhile, my workshop teaches responsive CSS media queries. So users
    can view your website on the browser without you even needing to waste
    time building an app.

  - It's much more effort to develop something meaningful in it. It
    requires learning new programming languages, huge API's, clunky
    IDE's, and slow build times and emulators.

    Compare that to instant feedback loops in web products. You're out
    to market faster.

  - The market is very picky

    There are already elite mobile applications for basically every
    business idea.

    Let's say you try to create a competitor. Mobile users do not like lag or
    bad UI's. They can review your application and leave negative reviews
    for something just not being their taste. If (heaven forbid) you have an
    actual glitch, they can be far less forgiving.

  - Even if you create a sweet app - you will still likely fail. Most people who
    sign up as Apple developers never even earn their $99 back:

    .. epigraph::

        "I wonder if I count as a nonprofit since I've spent way more in
        Apple developer fees than I have made from any of my apps?"

        <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16064038>`__)

  My courses teach you how to create database driven REST API's that serve as a
  backend.

  There's also another option if you need to build a first-class mobile app
  down the road. My workshops cover ECMAScript (JavaScript). You could take what
  you've learned and use `react-native`_.
