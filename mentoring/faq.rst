- What makes you better than other python tutors?

  See :ref:`mentoring/about_me`.

  You want someone who has worked at startups and brings experience to
  the table. You are entrepreurial-minded. You seek autonomy and to build your
  own product and vision. Specify your own deliverables and technical
  requirements. You're ready and willing to make an investment in your
  future. You value raw insight and knowledge first and foremost.

- Are you better than a code school?

  See above. Not to take a knock at code schools, many are great. But compare me
  side-by-side with instructors at an average code school. They're often
  contractors (with no labor protections) paid less than 50k a year. Many were
  themselves students from a prior class - not open source practitioners or
  startup veterans.

  And then those teachers go around and tell you you're going to make
  80k-100k when they themselves aren't. If they were so good at programming
  and the market is in such need for programmers (it's already saturated), why
  wouldn't they already be employed earning a higher wage?

  I serve a different type of student. You yourself want to be a founder. My
  ideal student already has a career and savings - and are trying to augment
  what they *already* have.
  
  Their teaching experience also sucks. They have little to no one-on-one time -
  cramming 10, 15, or 20 students into a class. They can't teach street smarts,
  they haven't been through the ups and downs of startups to give you candid
  advice. Take your normal McAcademy BootCamp instructor, put them one-on-one
  with me in a Hackathon, it'd be a slaughter.

  A big sticking point of bootcamps is some form of job afterwards,
  sometimes by the way of refunding if you don't get employed within a certain
  amount of time. If you want a guarantee of employment, go to a camp, they can
  be a "safety net" for you. But then, if you're risk averse and want job
  security, why are you doing startups?

  Want to work at Google? Study computer science, data structures and
  algorithms. Buy *Cracking the Code Interview* - a book that provides
  no useful skill outside interviewing. You can sit fantasizing you'll be the
  token Google hire after learning Angular, but it's more likely you'll be
  working at Trader Joe's with $16k down the drain.

  Don't fall for these mills. **Don't become a programmer out of desperation!**
  Bootcamps take advantage of your naivete through creating an illusion their
  flimsy accredition matters. Nobody cares. In fact, there are reports of
  interviewers **throwing out resumes from code camps** [1]_ [2]_.
  
  My approach kills three birds with one stone: Superior teacher,
  superior developer, and I don't feed into systems that take advantage of
  people who don't know better.

- Why don't you offer job positions / outcomes?

  1. I don't want students who are desperate, out of options, and see
     programming as a last ditch effort to find employment.

  2. The ideal student already has a career and is augmenting or
     improving what they already have.

  3. The job market is already saturated with boot camp graduates over the
     past years.

  4. It's a risky career path an an employee. There are no unions. There are
     few protections to shield you from bad bosses, VC funding drying up,
     bad equity deals, and so on. Too much power on the side of the
     employer.

  5. No respect for seniority
     
     Being a programmer as an *employee* isn't the panacaea it's made to be on
     TV. After a few years of hard work, you'll become a senior programmer.
    
     *Startup route*

     You'll find, much to your shock, founders view you as "just another
     programmer".
     
     If it's a startup, **you may have more experience than your own founder**.
     That's a disaster waiting to happen, and you'll always lose that one.

     In 10 years, I've never had a phone call back from a startup founder who
     thought they knew software better than me say "I'm so sorry for my hubris
     and acting like I knew more than you as an expert, you were right." That's
     pretty scary - because it also shows they can't humble themselves to learn.

     *Large organizations*
     
     Larger organizations tell you to go to the back of the line and do
     brainteasers, code golf, and so on. No respect for seniority. Do you
     think you can be a better programmer than me? Will people at Google,
     Uber, and so on use your software? Because even if you're demonstrably
     elite, these companies still force you to do dog tricks to let you
     know, `you're no snowflake`_.
     
     What was once a test of merit to harvest computer science chops has
     devolved into a draconian filter that serves as a passport to protect an
     entrenched system of careerists and bozos, not the best to perform a job.

     This fundamentally prohibits you from reaching your potential.

     *Exceptions*

     Entreprenuers, founders, DIY-types. **Building your own portfolio of
     intellectual property and attaining customers is the ultimate validation of
     yourself**. I did it myself when I wrote my book. I'm doing it again now
     with my SAAS tools.
     
     **Those currently employed augmenting their career with awesome Python
     skills** is another avenue for those in a position that has job security 
     in the foreseeable future.

  6. One-on-one teaching makes it untenable to give guarantees to students. I
     run a small shop where I give attention to gifted students on an
     individualized basis.
     
     Code camps are able to because they have 30 students in a class. If
     they have one drop out, they're shielded some what.

  7. Personal principles

     I am a true believer that those who have succeeded in their paths should
     pass down their knowledge to the next generation. Learning is
     everything. But not if you're going into debt. Not if you're attention
     is being split between 10-30 other people.

     There used to be a time where if you learned a trade, you'd be an
     apprentice of someone who is a master. These days, there's some slothy
     instructor passing scantrons down an aisle 15 rows deep. And your
     earliest influences you met every day, your teachers, conditioned
     you to think it's OK. And your teachers have more *far more* job security
     than most.
- Mobile development?

  Unfortunately, I don't provide that. Here's why:
  
  - It's a specialty. It's hard to pick up iOS or Android without going
    all-in.
    
  - For a student, it's much harder.
    
    - I estimate it taking you a year or longer to master it. That's not
      including backend stuff, which is a missing piece for many app
      developers I've seen.
    - There are already mobile developers that have been doing this
      for 8+ years. You're competing against seasoned pros that were
      around since there early days. It's hard to tie that in to a
      career or your own enterprise.

    Meanwhile, my workshop teaches responsive CSS media queries. So users
    can view your website on the browser without you even needing to waste
    time building an app.

  - It's much more effort to develop something meaningful in it. It
    requires learning new programming languages, huge API's, clunky
    IDE's, and slow build times and emulators.

    Compare that to instant feedback loops in web products. You're out
    to market faster.

  - The market is very picky

    There are already elite mobile applications for basically every
    business idea.

    Let's say you try to create a competitor. Mobile users do not like lag or
    bad UI's. They can review your application and leave negative reviews
    for something just not being their taste. If (heaven forbid) you have an
    actual glitch, they can be far less forgiving.

  - Even if you create a sweet app - you will still likely fail. Most people who
    sign up as Apple developers never even earn their $99 back:

        "I wonder if I count as a nonprofit since I've spent way more in
        Apple developer fees than I have made from any of my apps?"

  My courses teach you how to create database driven REST API's that serve as a
  backend.

  There's also another option if you need to build a first-class mobile app
  down the road. My workshops cover ECMAScript (JavaScript). You could take what
  you've learned and use `react-native`_.
