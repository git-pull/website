Brain dump: it's a real term according to Wikipedia
---------------------------------------------------

My courses are based off the best technologies for running your own
show. My mentoring workshops are all about learning the skills and
frameworks needed to create a **software as a service** capable of generating
passive income.

These workshops are **fully remote**. All you need is a terminal, slack, skype,
or Google Hangouts, internet, and most importantly, **a hunger to learn**.

**Python is a cool programming language**. I recommend it often on HN [1]_ [2]_.
Django is a choice web framework for taking your idea into something
you can execute on, and own. This tech stack is one you won't regret.

Maintain a controlling interest of the intellectual property you
create. Be master of your own life, take charge and learn to program.
Do it so you can contribute to your own idea, your partners, or teams.

I focus and obsess on building and improving products. I take a positive 
approach with students and always am happy to understand what their goals
are and what is technical viable.

Elite Tech Stack
----------------

These are my choice goto components I use to build with every day. I've
used it in open source, at startups, on my own websites. I stick with them
for one reason: **They move mountains**.

**Python** is the best programming language for generalist stuff and backends of
websites.

**Django** is a solid, popular, permissively licensed web framework with
great third party packages, solid documentation, and it's based in Python.

**JavaScript** is an essential glue when building websites. ES5 + ES6

**React / Vue** for front-end.

See an example project of mine at https://cv.git-pull.com, and view the source 
code at https://github.com/tony/cv.

Learning the **terminal** well helps you along the way, whether you're on your
local machine or SSH'ing in remotely. (`Check out my book`_ *The Tao of
tmux* on Leanpub)

**E-commerce integration** is one of the toughest things. It's tedious, but essential
to getting single-time and recurring income. Wiring it in correctly can
give you a self-service SAAS website. I've spend hundreds of hours setting
up solutions in `Stripe`_. I love Stripe.

Flexible
--------

Courses are fully remote. `Slack`_ is the program used to chat (just like
at a startup). Skype/Hangouts for screen sharing. Atom / VSCode or VIM +
tmux for programming.

The program operates on a rolling basis. You can start any time of the year,
as long as their is space.

In addition, you can choose to split the 3 day workshops up into different
days. Just ask to schedule with me.

After your workshop
-------------------

Helping you succeed in wrapping your brain around concepts of our courses
is important to me. You are a student of mine, and that is something that has
dignity and esteem to it.

After a workshop is complete, you can contact me when you hit a road block, and
I will respond within one business day, or connect with you live if needed.

      **Weekly follow-ups**

      In addition, there are one hour conversations we schedule during the week.
      This can be used to talk about what you're building, help you with
      debugging, and so on.
