Python Mentoring for Entrepreneurs
==================================

About | :ref:`FAQ <mentoring/faq>`

Take the leap into Python
-------------------------

You want to learn a stack of technologies perfect for running your own
show. My mentoring workshops are all about teaching best technologies and
frameworks that are available for starting your own web-based business.

These programs are fully remote. All you need is a terminal, skype or Google
Hangouts, internet, and most importantly, a hunger to learn.

Python is a *cool* programming language. I recommend it often HN [1]_ [2]_.
Django is a choice web framework for taking your idea into something
you can execute on, and own. This tech stack is one you won't regret.

That's another point. When you build your own website, not only is there
no boss to suck up to, you maintain a controlling interest. It's about
being master of your own life.

(Business? I also provide :ref:`consulting services in Python <consulting>`)

Elite tech stack
----------------

Python is the best programming language for generalist stuff and backends of
websites.

JavaScript is an essential glue when building websites.

Learning the terminal well helps you along the way, whether you're on your
local machine or SSH'ing in remotely.

E-commerce integration is one of the toughest things. It's boring. But you hav
someone who has done it before to explain it to you.

The stuff fits.

Programming is hard. You won't be a prodigy overnight. But your time spent
here will be worth it. For years to come, you'll look back at the insight
taught and mix in your own philosophy to set yourself apart.

That's why this oppurtunity is special compared to others. I put my name on
it. And I'm going to do everything in my power to make it work for you.

You're prepared to make a financial investment in learning, but also
to put your time and concentration into it. You know that becoming a
programmer isn't easy.

Weekly follow ups
"""""""""""""""""

Checking up on your progress and helping you succeed in wrapping your
brain around these concepts is important to me. You are a student of
mine, and that is something that has dignity and esteem to it.

For the period after a workshop, you can contact me when you hit a
road block, and I will respond within one business day, or
connect with you live if needed.

In addition, there are one hour conversations we schedule during the week. This
can be used to talk about what you're building, help you with debugging, and so
on.
