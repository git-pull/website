Take the leap into Python
-------------------------

You want to learn a stack of technologies perfect for running your own
show. My mentoring workshops are all about teaching best technologies and
frameworks that are available for starting your own web-based business.

These workshops are fully remote. All you need is a terminal, skype or Google
Hangouts, internet, and most importantly, a hunger to learn.

Python is a *cool* programming language. I recommend it often on HN [1]_ [2]_.
Django is a choice web framework for taking your idea into something
you can execute on, and own. This tech stack is one you won't regret.

That's another point. When you build your own website, not only is there
no boss to suck up to, you maintain a controlling interest. It's about
being master of your own life.

Programming is hard. You won't become a prodigy overnight. But your time spent
here will be worth it. For years to come, you'll look back at the insights
and mix in your own philosophy to set yourself apart.

That's why this oppurtunity is special compared to others. I put my name on
it. And I'm going to do everything in my power to make it work for you.

You're prepared to make a financial investment to learn, and also
to put your time and concentration into your studies.

(Business? I also provide :doc:`consulting services in Python </consulting/index>`)

Elite Tech Stack
----------------

**Python** is the best programming language for generalist stuff and backends of
websites.

**Django** is a solid, popular, permissively licensed web framework with
great third party packages, solid documentation, and it's based in Python.

**JavaScript** is an essential glue when building websites.

Learning the **terminal** well helps you along the way, whether you're on your
local machine or SSH'ing in remotely. (`Check out my book`_ *The Tao of
tmux* on Leanpub)

**E-commerce integration** is one of the toughest things. It's tedious, but essential
to getting single-time and recurring income. Wiring it in correctly can
give you a self-service SAAS website. I've spend hundreds of hours setting
up solutions in `Stripe`_. I love Stripe.

Flexible
--------

Courses are fully remote. `Slack`_ is the program used to chat (just like
at a startup). Skype/Hangouts for screen sharing. Atom / VSCode or VIM +
tmux for programming.

The program operates on a rolling basis. You can start any time of the year,
as long as their is space.

In addition, you can choose to split the 3 day workshops up into different
days. Just ask to schedule with me.

After your workshop
-------------------

Checking up on your progress and helping you succeed in wrapping your
brain around concepts in our courses is important to me. You are a student
of mine, and that is something that has dignity and esteem to it.

For the period after a workshop, you can contact me when you hit a
road block, and I will respond within one business day, or
connect with you live if needed.

      **Weekly follow ups**

      In addition, there are one hour conversations we schedule during the week.
      This can be used to talk about what you're building, help you with

      **Flexible follow ups**

      Students taking my workshops can opt to use their credit to check in

      ask. No problem!
