Mentoring
=========

You want to learn a stack of technologies perfect for running your own
show. My mentoring workshops are all about teaching best technologies and
frameworks that are available for starting your own web-based business.

I also provide :ref:`consulting`.

Elite tech stack
----------------

Python is the best programming language for generalist stuff and backends of
websites.

JavaScript is an essential glue when building websites.

Learning the terminal well helps you along the way, whether you're on your
local machine or SSH'ing in remotely.

E-commerce integration is one of the toughest things. It's boring. But you hav
someone who has done it before to explain it to you.

The stuff fits.

Programming is hard. You won't be a prodigy overnight. But your time spent
here will be worth it. For years to come, you'll look back at the insight
taught and mix in your own philosophy to set yourself apart.

That's why this oppurtunity is special compared to others. I put my name on
it. And I'm going to do everything in my power to make it work for you.

You're prepared to make a financial investment in learning, but also
to put your time and concentration into it. You know that becoming a
programmer isn't easy.

About me
--------

My name is Tony Narlock. I'm a seasoned open source participant who has
contributed to over 100 open source projects, created my own popular projects
such as tmuxp (a tmux session manager). I am `an author <https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux>`_,
and have worked at a Y Combinator startup and a NYU Poly Incubator startup that
was acquired by Merkle.

FAQ
---

- What makes you better than other python tutors?

  See `about me`_.

  You want someone who has worked at startups and brings experience to
  the table. You are entrepreurial-minded. You seek autonomy and to build your
  own product and vision. Specify your own deliverables and technical
  requirements. You're ready and willing to make an investment in your
  future. You value raw insight and knowledge first and foremost.

- Are you better than a code school?

  See above. Not to take a knock at code schools, many are great. But compare me
  side-by-side with instructors at an average code school. They're often
  contractors (with no job security) paid less than 50k a year. Many were
  themselves students - not open source practitioners or startup veterans.

  They also have little one-on-one time, they're mills that cram 10, 15, or 20
  students into a cohort. Or street smarts, they're not startup alumni. Take
  your normal McAcademy BootCamp instructor, put them one-on-one with me in a
  Hackathon, I'd shred them to pieces.

  The final thing is the guarantee of a job afterwards. I focus on
  entrepreneurial minded people who want to do their own startup. If you
  want a guarantee of employment, go to a camp, they can be a "safety net"
  for you. But then, if you can't take risks and want job security, why are you
  doing startups?

  Want to work at Google? Study computer science, data structures and
  algorithms. Buy Cracking the Code Interview. You can sit their
  fantasizing you'll be the token Google hire after learning Angular, but it's
  more likely you'll be working at Trader Joe's with $16k down the drain.

- Mobile development?

  Unfortunately, I don't provide that. Here's why:
  
  - It's a specialty. It's hard to pick up iOS or Android without going
    all-in.
    
  - For a student, it's much harder.
    
    - I estimate it taking you a year or longer to master it. That's not
      including backend stuff, which is a missing piece for many app
      developers I've seen.
    - There are already mobile developers that have been doing this
      for 8+ years. You're competing against seasoned pros that were
      around since there early days. It's hard to tie that in to a
      career or your own enterprise.

    Meanwhile, my workshop teaches responsive CSS media queries. So users
    can view your website on the browser without you even needing to waste
    time building an app.

  - It's much more effort to develop something meaningful in it. It
    requires learning new programming languages, huge API's, clunky
    IDE's, and slow build times and emulators.

    Compare that to instant feedback loops in web products. You're out
    to market faster.

  - The market is very picky

    There are already elite mobile applications for basically every
    business idea.

    Let's say you try to create a competitor. Mobile users do not like lag or
    bad UI's. They can review your application and leave negative reviews.

  - Even if you create a sweet app - you will still likely fail. Most people who
    sign up as Apple developers never even earn their $99 back:

    .. epigraph::

        "I wonder if I count as a nonprofit since I've spent way more in
        Apple developer fees than I have made from any of my apps?"

        -- invalidusernam3 (`source
        <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16064038>`__)

  My courses teach you how to create database driven REST API's that serve as a
  backend.

  There's also another option if you need to build a first-class mobile app
  down the road. My workshops cover ECMAScript (JavaScript). You could take what
  you've learned and use `react-native`_.
