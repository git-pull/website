Hire me
=======

I never have availability or spare time. I can create time, sometimes.

If it's Python.

If it's remote.

I get a lot of work done. I've been told I'm productive.

And a good team player.

I like to participate in open source. I am starting up a new project
called devel.tech.

If you have your series {A,B,C} raised and want to talk, email me at
tony (at) git-pull.com.

If I don't respond, it's probably because I got busy, not because
what you wrote.
