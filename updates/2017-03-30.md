# _The Tao of tmux, March 2017 update_

Last year I began a book for learning tmux called _The Tao of tmux_. It is based off a free resource
[originally part of the documentation](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/en/latest/about_tmux.html) of
[tmuxp](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com), a tmux session manager.

I made it available for free online at <https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read>.

Since February of this year, I have incorporated suggestions and feedback from readers on quality
and completeness of the book. For one, I have passed the book through a professional editor, as well
as rounded out chapters with summaries and even added 3 new sections, including:

- Sending keys to tmux, aka `send-keys`
- Copying pane contents to the paste buffer programmatically, aka `capture-pane`
- Building and using [tmux-mem-cpu-load](https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load)

Countless areas of the book have been rewritten for clarity. The process of editing alone fielded
_over 650_ tweaks. New graphics have been added. The configuration chapter has been overhauled, and
various new examples of usage for [targets](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.9/man1/tmux.1#COMMANDS)
(`-t`) and [formats](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.9/man1/tmux.1#FORMATS) (`-F`) have been added.

The book is available for purchase on Leanpub, in DRM-free epub, mobi and pdf format at
<https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux>.
