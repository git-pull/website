====================================
*The Tao of tmux, March 2017 update*
====================================

Last year I began a book for learning tmux called *The Tao of tmux*. It is based off a free resource `originally part of the documentation <https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/en/latest/about_tmux.html>`_ of `tmuxp <https://tmuxp.git-pull.com>`_, a tmux session manager.

I made it available for free online at https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read.

Since February of this year, I have incorporated suggestions and feedback from readers on quality and completeness of the book. For one, I have passed the book through a professional editor, as well as rounded out chapters with summaries and even added 3 new sections, including:

- Sending keys to tmux, aka ``send-keys``
- Copying pane contents to the paste buffer programmatically, aka ``capture-pane``
- Building and using `tmux-mem-cpu-load <https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load>`_

Countless areas of the book have been rewritten for clarity. The process of editing alone fielded *over 650* tweaks. New graphics have been added. The configuration chapter has been overhauled, and various new examples of usage for `targets <http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.9/man1/tmux.1#COMMANDS>`_ (``-t``) and `formats <http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-5.9/man1/tmux.1#FORMATS>`_ (``-F``) have been added.

The book is available for purchase on Leanpub, in DRM-free epub, mobi and pdf format at https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux.
