Am I a good fit for your project?
---------------------------------

**Services start at $5,000.** This is a **Python / Javascript** shop. Django is
my main area of expertise. My service covers every end of development, from
planning, documenting, testing, and deployment. I am **US-based**
(**CST timezone**) and **fully remote**.

Save money and get to market faster. Bypass ambivalent engineers that don't
understand your business goals. A seasoned software developer will be on
your side to help you avoid headaches and build high quality projects

      **Stripe E-Commerce Integration**

      Monthly billing. Multiple plans. Discounts. Payment workflow.

      Full-service SAAS solutions are more time consuming than they look,
      and it's hard. You need someone with experience who can put billing
      into place, have it work, and make it stick.

      :doc:`Learn more about our philosophy for billing <./stripe-integration>`

      **Data-processing and Scraping**

      Pull information from sources and documents, matching patterns,
      process.

      **Anything else Python / Django / Stripe**

      Wheelhouse is Python. And Django. And Stripe.

      **Backend API's / REST**

      If you're building a mobile application or developer API, you need
      an OAuth2-backed solution with permissions wired into the
      background. A skilled developer will listen to what your frontend
      needs are and help you show and make editable the correct content.

      **Planning**

      If you're getting the run around from slow developers, you may need help
      defining technical requirements. A skilled developer can help you break
      the job into manageable pieces that are acceptable to your team.

      Together we can develop a second opinion / action plan.

Built to last, by default.
--------------------------

All new code written on a project will comply with the following.
