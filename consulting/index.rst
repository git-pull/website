Am I a good fit for your project?
---------------------------------

**Services start at $5,000.** This is a **Python / Javascript** shop. Django is
my main area of expertise. My service covers every end of development, from
planning, documenting, testing, and deployment. I am **US-based**
(**CST timezone**) and **fully remote**.

understand your business goals. A seasoned software developer will be on
your side to scale and protect your company's technical interests.

      **Stripe E-Commerce Integration**

      Monthly billing. Multiple plans. Discounts. Payment workflow.

      Full-service SAAS solutions are more time consuming than they look,
      and it's hard. You need someone with experience who can put billing
      into place, have it work, and make it stick.

      :doc:`Learn more about our philosophy for billing <./stripe-integration>`

      **Data-processing and Scraping**

      Pull information from sources and documents, matching patterns,
      process.

      **Anything else Python / Django / Stripe**

      Wheelhouse is Python. And Django. And Stripe.

      **Backend API's / REST**

      If you're building a mobile application or developer API, you need
      an OAuth2-backed solution with permissions wired into the
      background. A skilled developer will listen to what your frontend
      needs are and help you show and make editable the correct content.

      **React / Vue.js frontend development**

      Build powerful user interfaces for your users with the latest tools.
      Services for React, Redux, and Reselect and Vue.js and Vuex.

      Wire-in filtering, drag and drop, graphs and visualizations.

      React and Vue.js components decouple your frontend interface to make
      them built to last.

      **Standards compliance**

        Keep code navigable in the long term. Classes and methods
        are prepared for API documentation.
      - Code Style (PEP8 / `Airbnb JS
        <https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>`__) - can be adjusted on
        request.
