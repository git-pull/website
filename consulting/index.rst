About me
--------

My name is Tony Narlock. I am creator of several open source Python projects:

- :doc:`tmuxp:index` (1800+ stars, packaged on debian) + :doc:`libtmux:index`
- :doc:`vcspull:index` + :doc:`libvcs:index`
- :doc:`cihai <cihai:index>` (:doc:`cli frontend <cihai-cli:index>`)
- :doc:`unihan-etl <unihan-etl:index>`

I am creator of a Django project:

- :doc:`django-slugify-processor:index`

An author of *The Tao of tmux* (2017).

I've written several articles that were well-received on tech
sites:

- `Django vs Flask <https://devel.tech/features/django-vs-flask/>`__
- `Pipenv: Holy grail for python environments <https://devel.tech/tips/n/pIpEnvNh/pipenv/>`__
- `How Django uses deferred imports to scale <https://devel.tech/tips/n/djms3tTe/how-django-uses-deferred-imports-to-scale/>`_

I've also contributed upstream to `hundreds of open source
projects <https://openhub.net/accounts/git-pull>`_, including `kaptan`_ (which
I'm a maintainer of), `django-model-utils <https://github.com/jazzband/django-model-utils>`_,
and `django-robots <https://github.com/jazzband/django-robots>`_.

I run two django-based websites, `devel.tech`_ and `HSKFlashCards`_.

I am a veteran of several startups, including a Y Combinator
company and an acquihire out of NYU Poly Incubator.
