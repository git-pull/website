Python, Django, and Stripe Development Services
===============================================

Am I a good fit for your project?
---------------------------------

**My services start at $5,000.** I focus on projects that are **primarily
python**. Django is my main area of expertise. My service covers every end of
development, from planning, documenting, testing, and deployment. I am
**US-based** (**CST timezone**) and **fully remote**.

You want stuff shipped and working well. Can you define your needs? Your
timeline? Your current situation? Your budget? You can't afford to waste
time to market with bad engineers that don't care about your business
goals. It's time to put your needs to paper. Let's look at what I can do:

What I can provide for you
--------------------------

.. container:: row

   .. container:: project col-xs-6

      **Stripe E-Commerce Integration**

      Monthly billing. Multiple plans. Discounts. Payment workflow.

      Full-service SAAS solutions are more time consuming than they look,
      and it's hard. You need someone with experience who can put billing
      into place, have it work, and make it stick.

      **Data-processing and Scraping**

      Pull information from sources and documents, matching patterns,
      process.

      **Anything else Python / Django / Stripe**

      Wheelhouse is Python. And Django. And Stripe.

   .. container:: project col-xs-6

      **Backend API's / REST**

      If you're building a mobile application or developer API, you need
      an OAuth2-backed solution with permissions wired into the
      background. A skilled developer will listen to what your frontend
      needs are and help you show and make editable the correct content.

      **Planning**

      If you're getting the run around from slow developers, you may need help
      defining technical requirements. A skilled developer can help you break
      the job into manageable pieces that are acceptable to your team.

      Together we can develop a second opinion / action plan.

Built to last, standard
-----------------------

All new code written on a project will comply with the following.

.. container:: row

   .. container:: project col-xs-6

      **Python 3.6**

      New code is written in the latest python version.

   .. container:: project col-xs-6

      **Standards compliance**

      - Documented (PEP257)

        That means code is navigable in the long term. Classes and methods
        are ready for API documentation.
      - Code Style (PEP8)

Who are you?
------------

My name is Tony Narlock. I am creator of several robust, open source Python
projects:

- :doc:`tmuxp:index` (1800+ ‚≠ê's, packaged on debian) + :doc:`libtmux:index`
- :doc:`vcspull:index` + :doc:`libvcs:index`
- :doc:`cihai <cihai:index>` (:doc:`cli frontend <cihai-cli:index>`)
- :doc:`unihan-etl <unihan-etl:index>`

I'm creator of the :doc:`django-slugify-processor:index` package.

Author of the book `The Tao of tmux <https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read>`_ (2017)

I've written several articles that were well-received on tech
sites:

- `Django vs Flask <https://devel.tech/features/django-vs-flask/>`__
- `Pipenv: Holy grail for python environments <https://devel.tech/tips/n/pIpEnvNh/pipenv/>`__
- `How Django uses deferred imports to scale <https://devel.tech/tips/n/djms3tTe/how-django-uses-deferred-imports-to-scale/>`_

I've also contributed upstream to `hundreds of open source
projects <https://openhub.net/accounts/git-pull>`_, including `kaptan`_ (which
I'm a maintainer of), `django-model-utils <https://github.com/jazzband/django-model-utils>`_,
and `django-robots <https://github.com/jazzband/django-robots>`_.

I run two django-based websites, `devel.tech`_, which is powered by my own
`docutils`_-based, db-backed CMS system. And `HSKFlashCards`_, which I inherited
from an ex-Googler.

(I forgot to mention, I'm a Google Summer of Code student and was also a mentor.)

I'm a veteran of several startups, including a Y Combinator
company and an acquihire out of NYU Poly Incubator.
