Why Python? (draft)
===================

I'm a polyglot. I have contributed to a variety of open source projects in
everything from Ruby to C++. I fully believe I'd be competent regardless
of programming language. However, my proficiency in Python is considerable.

I had conversations with a few founders looking for work in software stacks 
outside my core competency. I'm using this article to explain why I stick
to one thing, and not out of stubbornness.

I don't want to put you in a position where I'm not giving you my best.
You deserve no less. Especially win time is of the essence.

But honestly, I'm just enjoying reaping all these benefits of the toolchain
and well-documented, permissively licensed libraries, and wondering why you're 
not joining the party.

Who are you to say this?
------------------------

I am a prominent Python programmer. I've released multiple end-to-end 
Python projects. Some have large userbases, even distributed on major Linux
distributions. I stand by my track record.

A programming language not being my favorite isn't the sole reason I
may not be a fit at the time. But it's a strong indication there's
a better choice for you at the time.

If I'm not programming Python, I'm concerned I won't meet your expectations.
That would not only make me feel pretty bad, but worse, it could end up being
non-optimal to your objectives.

I try to avoid risky decisions as a software developer. I want to pick the
best tool for the job. In many common cases at startups - Python runs
circles around the other options.

In my past startups, I didn't have the power to override and enforce safer 
solutions that could have led the business to a better outcome.

I don't know your stack. But since Python suits so many generalist cases,
I want to take this chance to convey some information on why I think Python is 
best.

Why you should move to Python
-----------------------------

It's my recommendation your server-side, data, and scripting tools
to Python. Set forth below are the reasons why I think Python is the
best language for startups:

Performance
"""""""""""

- Python has libraries that leverage C speedups.
- Python has C API's baked into its main implementation
- Python has C

Web frameworks
""""""""""""""

- Flask is top tier microframework

Databases
"""""""""

- Solid abstraction layer, Database API
- Solid drivers (for the abstraction layer): psycopg2
- Solid ORM's: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Peewee ORM

Template engines
""""""""""""""""

- Django Templates
- Jinja 2

Maturity
""""""""

- Python is older than Java
- Python 3 has been around since
- 

Prominence
""""""""""

- Google's first search. YouTube.com uses it.
- Linux's package managers use it

Talent pool
"""""""""""

- According to StackOverflow, it's one of the most popular languages

Why I stick to Python
---------------------

Switching cost
""""""""""""""

For you: Depending on where you're at, you may not be able to pick a new
software stack.

For me: I would have to factor in extra time and cost into getting up to
speed with the language and libraries, in addition to your codebase and
startup.

Oppurtunity cost
""""""""""""""""

I'm more productive and efficient in Python. There are more and better
software libraries to leverage. Better debugging. Synchronous. All the
advantages in `Why you should move to Python`_.

Safety
------

I may not be as accurate in predicting the time and effort on deliverables. This
is not a risk I'm comfortable with introducing you to.

Even in the most optimistic of circumstances, your startup is often solving a 
much needed problem in a novel way. Sometimes, even with Python, we
realize the approach we decided on is harder than we (me and you) realized
at first. We don't always have enough information before hand, because
we're sort of in uncharted territory at times.

On the other hand, a lot of the stuff is also hard work, but stuff that
can be more predictable. When this is combined with a programming language
I'm already fluid in, this helps me give you a better outcome, while doing
everything I can to minimize not making a due date or performing under
expectations.

The case for "Blue Apron" Django sites
--------------------------------------

I believe in the advantage of a SAAS starter kits that can bootstrap
boilerplate code for SAAS startups.

This gives you the components and libraries - with a warranty (commercial
support).

This demo copy AGPLv3, All rights reserved. Only for demo purposes! We don't want
this leaking out on the internet :)

Comes with API's.

Tests.

Warranty (guarantee we'll keep a PyPI and source code available)

License Certificate (PDF, and .txt file for your source code tree)

If your startup and undergoing merger and acquisition due diligence, show
them your license to let them know it's fully transferrable upon acquisition.
Maybe it would be anyway. But we thought ahead to make explicit, any code
derived from it is also.
