I'm a polyglot. I have contributed to a variety of open source projects in
everything from Ruby to C++. I fully believe I'd be competent regardless
of programming language. However, my proficiency in Python is considerable.

I had conversations with a few founders looking for work in software stacks 
outside my core competency. Ultimately, I come to the conclusion I may not
be the best pick at the time because there's no advantage to me over
another programmer if you're not using Python. I'm just going to be
average.

I don't want to put you in a position where I'm not giving you my best.
You deserve no less. Especially when time is of the essence.

It's really good over here in Python land. Reaping these benefits of the toolchain
and well-documented, permissively licensed libraries. I'm wondering why you're 
not joining the party.

Who are you to say this?
------------------------

I am a prominent Python programmer. I've released multiple end-to-end 
Python projects. Some have large userbases, even distributed on major Linux
distributions. I stand by my track record.

In my past startups, I didn't have the power to override and enforce safer 
solutions that could have led the business to a better outcome. I've also
tried various combinations of software stacks, and learn how important
it is to stick to safe, effective technologies.

I don't refuse work solely based on me not liking a programming language.
If I'm not programming Python, I'm concerned I won't meet your expectations.
That would not only make me feel bad, but worse, it could end up being
non-optimal to your objectives.

I don't know your stack, and can't judge it. But since Python suits so many 
generalist cases, I want to take this chance to convey some information on why 
I think Python is best.

Why you should move to Python
-----------------------------

I think Python is best for server, data, and script code. I think it's
overall the best programming language for startups:

Performance
"""""""""""

- Python has libraries that leverage C speedups.
- Python has C API's baked into its main implementation
- Python has C

Web frameworks
""""""""""""""

- Flask is top tier microframework

Databases
"""""""""

- Solid abstraction layer, Database API
- Solid drivers (for the abstraction layer): psycopg2
- Solid ORM's: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Peewee ORM

Template engines
""""""""""""""""

- Django Templates
- Jinja 2

Maturity
""""""""

- Python is older than Java
- Python 3 has been around since
- 

Prominence
""""""""""

- Google's first search. YouTube.com uses it.
- Linux's package managers use it

Talent pool
"""""""""""

- According to StackOverflow, it's one of the most popular languages

Why I stick to Python
---------------------

Switching cost
""""""""""""""

For you: Depending on where you're at, you may not be able to pick a new
software stack.

For me: I would have to factor in extra time and cost into getting up to
speed with the language and libraries, in addition to your codebase and
startup.

Oppurtunity cost
""""""""""""""""

I'm more productive and efficient in Python. There are more and better
software libraries to leverage. Better debugging. Synchronous. All the
advantages in `Why you should move to Python`_.

Safety
------

I may not be as accurate in predicting the time and effort on deliverables. This
is not a risk I'm comfortable with introducing you to.

Even in the most optimistic of circumstances, your startup is often solving a 
much needed problem in a novel way. Sometimes, even with Python, we
realize the approach we decided on is harder than we (me and you) realized
at first. We don't always have enough information before hand, because
we're sort of in uncharted territory at times.

On the other hand, a lot of the stuff is also hard work, but stuff that
can be more predictable. When this is combined with a programming language
I'm already fluid in, this helps me give you a better outcome, while doing
everything I can to minimize not making a due date or performing under
expectations.
