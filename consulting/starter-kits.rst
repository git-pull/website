I believe in the advantage of a SAAS starter kits that can bootstrap
boilerplate code for SAAS startups.

This gives you the components and libraries - with a warranty (commercial
support).

This demo copy AGPLv3, All rights reserved. Only for demo purposes! We don't want
this leaking out on the internet :)

Comes with API's.

Tests.

Warranty (guarantee we'll keep a PyPI and source code available)

License Certificate (PDF, and .txt file for your source code tree)

If your startup and undergoing merger and acquisition due diligence, show
them your license to let them know it's fully transferrable upon acquisition.
Maybe it would be anyway. But we thought ahead to make explicit, any code
derived from it is also.
