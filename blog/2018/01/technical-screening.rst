Technical Screening
===================

When I get asked the question if I'll do a technical screen, I cringe.

The power between employer and employee has gotten so huge that I
face a kaleidoscope of scenarios. On the worse end of the spectrum,
it the bait and switch test. The problem is, the average programming
job seeker applying for startups is ghosted and given a pretty disenguous tests.
On the other hand, I've interviewed at places that googled me before hand, saw
my projects and code, my resume, and respected it. Sincerely respectful.

I worry that after dealing with 10's of cases of really unethical
interviewers, the attitude could boils over to sincere people who are simply
proceeding with candidates with a way they find is "normal".

I got my first jobs and have no technical interview required at all. They first
saw me coding in open source, then talked to me in person and realized I was
authentic. The other was through a startup incubator, they literally would
walk by me coding.

What you're saying by asking me to be screened is that I'm a fraud. That
after thousands of hours of me programming for nothing in return, I can't
have the base level of technical credibility for what's already done.

It's about evidence and you're sincerity to look.

One of the reasons I feel prickly about screening is I've a readily
demonstrable track record:

- I've published multiple pieces of software and libraries that by DoD/NASA
  standards are ready-to-go.
- I've contributed to over 100 open source projects.
- I've given support and help to people all around the world.
- I've worked at startup companies before and seen them fail and succeed
- I'm a published author. I've demonstrated capacity to take feedback
  and improve a book.

And in spite of the above, what technically do you really need? That
demonstrates seniority in a tech startup.

Why would I want to be put on the spot to prove it?

I've failed technical screenings. I'm probably one of the best python
programmers around. I don't say it out of pride or arrogance, but
when you do something day and night for 5 years straight with basically
no down time, you get good at it.

I've seen people pass technical screenings. And suck at programming.
They were inflexible. Sometimes they insisted on niche programming languages,
compounding their risk (and leading to subsequent delays and lost customers).
Not team players. They wanted job security, and were the force to jump ship and
have jobs waiting for them when the runway was spent.

If the question is my personality, let's be sure to separate candor
from arrogance. I'm simply relaying that if I'm a published software
that got code through 100 public open source projects, publish code
people at Fortune 500 companies use, and have people more junior than
me tell me I lack skill - I'm not being a troublemaker for calling the
sky blue.

As a manager or a founder, you will always have subordinates kiss
up to you. They want paychecks. They'll tell you sweet lies until
your runway runs out.

One of the reasons I'm getting into licensing and consulting is I only want to
deal with founders who let me talk on their level. Or just be a (co-?)founder
myself. One of my prime worries? How the hell am I going to screen people.
That may be one of mt next ideas.

I want to code and make an impact. And learn more, and get better,
even when I have gray hairs. *Cracking the Code Interview* and office politics
to me, is *lame* and *fake*.

I value my integrity and I protect it, in the same way I entrust
my full attention to yourself if I work as your partner, consultant,
or employee. All I ask is that the respect is mutual.
