When job interviewing tests fail
================================

Stop forcing job interview candidates to optimize on the spot

People who know data structures and algorithms, and respond well to on the
spot refactorings may have studied for your interview. But what are you
measuring?

How many seasoned programmers out there know the word for optimizing too
early? Even though performance matters, can you think of a reason why
holding it above all else could b

You don't have the data available yet to challenge your notions of the
codebase that you adjusted to. 3 days later, you will understand the
library you're interacting with better, with the added benefit of feedback
from pushing the code to stage and production to see how its working.

I have this process happen to me all the time when programming. Basically
never would I be able to have the intuition to guess ahead. And when I do
do optimize too early, time has taught me again and again that I'm no
Nostradamus of code.

I have the benefit now of programming alone. I still job interview now and then,
and I cringe when they ignore all our conversations, all my code, and prop
me in a shared notepad to solve a theoretical problem and optimize it,
knowing full well it resembles nothing you'd experience in the daily
grind.

The reason I cringe is I know python, Django, and web development enough
at this point to realize it doesn't work that way. And their true business
needs are not proportional to the level of data structure and algorithmic
rigor and grandiose, seer-inspired optimizations they seek to test for.


In my experience
================

It strikes me as a red flag if an organization gives me this test. If
you're in a position where you're hiring people, and you're willing to
reduce your candidate to a gimmick on the spot, which has questionable use
in assessing anything period, that shows they're lacking a in their own
intellectual honesty and earnesty. And pretty much everybody agrees that
startups are echo chambers, and no one wastes their day inverting binary
trees.

Case in point, Asana: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11376638, the fastest
and most intuitive SAAS product to come out of the valley decades.

This is a thread that shows Asana giving a really helpful interview guide
for us to perform well on stuff like inverting those binary trees. Stuff
that comes up all the time in in tmuxp, webpack, and all my django websites.

See, if you want to be a really star programmer and work at *Instagram*, what
happens is a message randomly pops out of your vim statusline. A spot light
immediately engulfs you, as the Oracles remotely hijack your browser to open a
shared textpad. In order to unlock the ability to legitmately attain money
programming (at all, on Earth), you have to create and optimize a random,
theoretical algorithm, on the spot. A clock starts. While an interviewer
sits behinds and smirks while your mind goes blank. "They're gonna choke, another
one *rolls eyes* *sighs*".

This is the big game. It's not for .1x amateurs that can't invert a binary
tree on the spot, by memory, after being up all night before an interview.

Clearly, Asana is unique snowflakes, so different than any other SV startup.
Definitely self-aware, humble, and poised to get a dose of praise served to
them when they published their blog post. Finally the world will see the
elite pedigree it takes to the elite of the elite, and how tough it is to 
to face the tough life-threatening realities of engineering web applications.

(You can tell this gives me consternation. But I have to collaterally
attack tests in this post. Future posts I'll try to develop exercises that may
more holistically gauge applicants.)

... Stop giving these tests, and realize they prove nothing, in fact, in
my experience serve to make things worse than they already are. I
understand how these tests are well-intentioned and how hard it is for
organizations to change.

No one from the inside is going to challenge some startup's group think, they
know how to play the game of poker, that's gonna lead to ostraciziation and 
eventual termination. Employees politely nod at "culture" because they don't
want to stick out. But I think everybody gets it's not so rosey or virtuous
once they see a colleague get thrown overboard unceremoniously.
